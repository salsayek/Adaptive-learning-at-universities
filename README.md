# Adaptive-learning-at-universities
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Large university cohorts and diverse student backgrounds often lead to uneven mastery in core STEM and AI courses. This project develops an AI powered adaptive learning system designed to personalize practice, adjust pacing and provide early warnings for at-risk students.
The goal is to improve academic performance, reduce time to mastery and support instructors with data-driven insights.

OBJECTIVES:
How can we deliver personalized practice based on each student’s proficiency level?
Can we design adaptive pacing that reacts to individual progress?
How effectively can AI provide early warnings for struggling students?
What impact do adaptive systems have on pass rates and retention?

AI techinques:
Knowledge Tracing (DKT, BKT, Transformers)
Sequence Modeling for learning behaviors
Recommendation Systems for personalized content
LLM-based tutoring with guardrails and explanation transparency

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
Increased pass rates and student retention
Reduced time to mastery
Improved instructor analytics and early interventions
More equitable learning outcomes across diverse cohorts

SKILLS:
Machine Learning Supervised learning 

PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS:
Student data protection (GDPR-compliant)
Transparency in AI explanations
Academic integrity safeguards
Opt-out options for students
Bias detection and monitoring
